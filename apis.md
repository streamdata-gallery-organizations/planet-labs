description: Founded in 2010 by a team of ex-NASA scientists, Planet Labs is driven
  by a mission to image the entire Earth every day, and make global change visible,
  accessible, and actionable. We started as a small team of physicists, aerospace
  and mechanical engineers in a garage, using the cubesat form-factor to inform the
  first designs of our Dove satellite. Just two years after our first satellite entered
  space, Planet now operates the largest constellation of Earth-imaging satellites...ever.
  Our satellites are collecting a radical new data set with endless, real-world applications.
  Whether you&rsquo;re measuring agricultural yields, monitoring natural resources,
  or aiding first responders after natural disasters, our data is here to lend businesses
  and humanitarian organizations a helping hand. Planet believes timely, global imagery
  will empower informed, deliberate and meaningful stewardship of our planet.
